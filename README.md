## Installation procedures
#### 1.	Database preparation.     
You have to create a user name of your database system, obtain the ip address,access port,username and password
```Bash 
e.g. CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
```
#### 2.	Create a database.      
Create a database. Grand privileges to the user created in step 1.  
```Bash 
e.g. # if the name of your database called userdb
     # you can enter mySQL using command line 'mysql -u guest -p', then use following codes.
     GRANT all privileges ON userdb.* TO 'username'@'%'
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
#### 3.	Create database tables.      
The path of initiation script is: `CAFE_PORTAL/init.sql`     
You have to enter mySQL, use the database in step2 and run this script.      
You should first enter the directory `CAFE_PORTAL/init.sql` of the CAFE-PORTAL source code folder.
Then You have to enter mySQL using command line `mysql -u {username} -p`, use the database created in `step2` and run the following script.
```Bash 
use {jdbc.database}
source init.sql;
``` 
#### 4.	Grant write permission. [For Linux]     
Grant write permission to `ts_search/assets` and `ts_search/protected/runtime`       
#### 5. Database access configuration.     
Find the file `CAFE_PORTAL/ts_search/protected/config/main.php` and replace the database information from line `57` to line `64`. For example:
```php		
'db'=>array(
			'connectionString' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=userdb',
			'emulatePrepare' => true,
			'username' => 'guest',
			'password' => '123456',
			'charset' => 'utf8',
            'tablePrefix'=>'ts_',
		 ),
``` 
#### 6. Server access configuration.       
find the file `CAFE_PORTAL/ts_search/protected/models/TSInterface.php` and modify the NODE server root address in line2, for example, if you want to connect the web appication to the CAFE node configured on 100.101.100.111:8088, the root path in the tomcat server of that node is  `/worker-node`, you can use following code:
```php
define('TSInterfaceROOT','http://100.101.100.111:8088/worker-node/');   
``` 
#### 7. Modify the virtual directory.     
```Bash 
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default  
# Then Configure the virtual directory `/CAFE_PORTAL/ts_search` after "DocumentRoot" keyword
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart    #restart Apache
``` 

#### 8. A brief how-to-use guide
- After setting up the portal, open the index page and create an account.
- Login with that account, then click search to find the wanted data (filtered by Institute, Model, Experiment, etc.)
- Choose a set of data and specify start/end year and the ncl functions you want to use.
- Spatial Ranger specification: South/North from -90 to 90, and West/East from 0 to 360.
- Submit task and view status/result in the redirected window, you can also download the result after task finished.

#### 9. Some problems you may encounter
- 403 forbidden, Permission denied: access to / denied

  check access permission in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, and check if the /, root directory have +x privileges (every level of the parent directories should have that priviledge).
